This is a simple Qt GUI to realize the Feature extraction, Descriptor computation and Feature matching.
This version is compiled with qmake.

## 1.Prerequisities
This project is developed in Ubuntu 16.04.

### C++11 or C++0x Compiler
Until now I just used the normal C++ fuctionalities. No special things from C++11.
### OpenCV
I use OpenCV to deal with images and feature points. Required at least 2.4.3.

## 2.Dataset
The user can use the test images which are located in the data folder to checkt the result.
